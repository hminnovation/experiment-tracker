2022-05-13: This is a first attempt at creating an experimenter tracker. It relies on having Python3 and nextJS.


This example content file shows how you need to prepare your content. To add a new experiment follow the syntax of the below examples. Specifically:
* The experiment title needs a hashtag (e.g # Experiment title)
* Every other field needs the key name (e.g. ‘Belief:’)
* All fields are optional
* **Strong**, _emphasis_ and [link](https://#) markdown syntax is allowed. Everything is will blow stuff up
* You can have as many, or as few, hypotheses from an experiment as you’d like. You need to separate them with three asterisks e.g. ‘***’
* The order in this document isn’t important. The date field is currently what’s used for sorting.


You probably shouldn’t use this text file to make changes but have a master doc in Google Docs (other providers available!) where you’ll get ‘version history’ of the doc and multiple authors can easily contribute.


Once you’re happy with the contents, save/update the file and, from Terminal, run
* python3 txt_to_md.py


This section of the document will be ignored. The rest of the document will be read. You will end up with a folder structure of
- experiments/
– experiment1/
—-- index.md
—-- hypotheses/
—------ hypothesis1.md
—------ hypothesis2.md
– experiment2/
—-- index.md
—-- hypotheses/
—------ hypothesis1.md
—------ hypothesis2.md

# Experiment 1
Date: 2022-05-28


<hypotheses>
Belief: That the hypothesis for experiment 1 would be good
Status: Validated
Why: We discovered that this worked.
New thinking: We now believe that we can have a more generalised view about how future experiments will work.
</hypotheses>




# Experiment 2
Date: 2022-05-29


<hypotheses>
Belief: That we could do this in an hour
Status: Validated
Why: Successfully deployed to Github
***
Belief: That it would be useful
Status: Invalidated
Why: No evidence to support the hypothesis
New thinking: That we need to do a subsequent experiment (gotta get paid after all!)
***
Belief: That GPT4 would have been quicker
Status: Invalidated 
New thinking: The hypotheses the machine gave were rubbish. Your job is safe!
